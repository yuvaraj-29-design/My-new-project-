# My AI Project

## Summary

This project is created as part of the [Elements of AI - Building AI](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/) course.  
The idea is to build a simple AI model that can classify whether a short text is a positive or negative sentiment using basic natural language processing and machine learning.

## Background

Understanding sentiment from text is useful in customer reviews, social media monitoring, and feedback analysis.  
This project uses a preprocessed dataset of labeled sentences and applies a basic neural network classifier.

## How It Works

- Data cleaning (stop words, lowercase, punctuation)
- Convert text to numerical vectors using TF-IDF
- Use a feedforward neural network with Keras or Scikit-learn
- Train the model and test accuracy

## Future Improvements

- Use a bigger dataset like IMDB or Twitter
- Try a transformer model (like BERT)
- Add web interface to type a sentence and get prediction
